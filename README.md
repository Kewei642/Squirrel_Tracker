Author: Kewei Chen, Jingshan Shi

## Project Description

Squirrel Tracker tracks all the known squirrels in the Central Park. You can edit, add, view the squirrel data and see them in the map from [our website.](https://tools-for-analytics-1-255421.appspot.com/)  
The number of squirrels are still growing, and it needs you contribution. This project uses data from [2018 Central Park Sq Census](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). If you want to share more information with us, you can add the squirrel in the website or contact us by kc3320@columbia.edu or js5607@columbia.edu.
